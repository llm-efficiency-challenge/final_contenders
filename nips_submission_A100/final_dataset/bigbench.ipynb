Suppose now that I knew that King Charles was hidden in your stable-loft: such might be the case, and your father be ignorant of it, and his assertion of his ignorance would be believed; but if I were to tell your father that the king was there, and it was afterward discovered, do you not see that, by confiding such a secret to him, I should do harm, and perhaps bring him into trouble?\\' \\'I perceive now, Edward; do you mean to say that you know where the king is concealed? for, if you do, I must beg of you not let my father know any thing about it. As you say, it would put him in a difficult position, and must eventually harm him much. There is a great difference between wishing well to a cause and supporting it in person. My father wishes the king well, I believe, but, at the same time, he will not take an active part, as you have already seen; at the same time, I am convinced that he would never betray the king if he knew where he was. I say, therefore, if that is your secret, keep it from him, for his sake and for mine, Edward, if you regard me.\\' \\'You know not how much I regard you, Patience. I saw many highborn women when I was away, but none could I see equal to Patience Heatherstone, in my opinion; and Patience was ever in my thoughts during my long absence.\\' \\'I thank you for your kind feelings toward me,\\' replied Patience; \\'but, Master Armitage, we were talking about your secret.\\' \\'Master Armitage!\\' rejoined Edward; \\'how well you know how to remind me, by that expression, of my obscure birth and parentage, whenever I am apt to forget the distance which I ought to observe!\\' \\'You are wrong!\\' replied Patience; \\'but you flattered me so grossly, that I called you Master Armitage to show that I disliked flattery, that was all. I dislike flattery from those who are above me in rank, as well as those who are below me; and I should have done the same to any other person, whatever his condition might be. But forget what I said, I did not mean to vex you, only to punish you for thinking me so silly as to believe such nonsense.\\' \\'Your humility may construe that into flattery which was said by me in perfect sincerity and truth-that I can not help,\\' replied Edward. \\'I might have added much more, and yet have been sincere; if you had not reminded me of my not being of gentle birth, I might have had the presumption to have told you much more; but I have been rebuked.\\' Edward finished speaking, and Patience made no reply; they walked on for several moments without exchanging another syllable.\"\\n  choice: \"When do you purpose going back to the New Forest?

Let us ride on away from this, and we will talk over the matter as we go; but depend upon it, the further south we get the safer we shall be, but still not safe, unless we can change our costume.

This sudden attack from behind decided the affair. The Parliamentary troopers, thinking that there were more than two coming upon them, made off after another minute\\'s combat, leaving five or six of their men on the ground. \\'Thanks, Chaloner! thanks, Beverley!\\' said a voice which they immediately recognized.

No more than two should ride together. Depend upon it, we shall have more of the troops here directly.\\' The men, about fifteen in number, who had been in company with Grenville, considered that Chaloner\\'s advice was good, and without ceremony set off, with their horses\\' heads to the northward, leaving Chaloner, Edward, and Grenville together on the field of the affray. About a dozen men were lying on the ground, either dead or severely wounded: seven of them were of the king\\'s party, and the other five of the Parliamentary troops. \\'Now, what I propose,\\' said Edward, \\'is this: let us do what we can for those who are wounded, and then strip off the dresses and accouterments of those Parliamentary dragoons who are dead, and dress ourselves in them, accouterments and all.\"\\n  choice: \"To Hamilton\\'s we accordingly went on the 15th of April, 1885.
