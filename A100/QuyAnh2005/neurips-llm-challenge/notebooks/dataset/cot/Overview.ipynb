How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n","Answer: Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years’ ship. The second hundred years’ ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people. The third hundred years’ ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = 4S people.

In short the theory is an explanation of the mechanism for the generation of diversity of antibody specificity.
