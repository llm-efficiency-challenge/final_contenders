In 1818, a heavy two-wheeled device called a \"velocipede\" was patented in Paris. The rider controlled the direction with a steering wheel and moved it forward by pushing his feet on the ground. It caught on briefly, and many people worked to refine its design. In 1863, pedals were added. A few years later, a new, lighter bike was developed that used a very large front wheel and a small rear wheel. Called the \"Ariel,\" it became popular but was quite accident-prone. Over the next decade, \"safety\" bicycles were produced, incorporating welcome improvements such as air-filled rubber tires, brakes, and gears. By 1899, about a million bicycles were in use.

How can the writer best improve his or her ideas and development?\nAsthma is a lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe. When people have asthma, their breathing passages can become inflamed, swelling up and filling with mucus. Emphysema is another lung disease that makes people short of breath. In people with asthma, inflamed airways become sensitive to smoke and dust, and as a result, the muscles of the airway can tighten up. All of these things make the passages narrow, so it's hard for air to move through. As a result, people with asthma sometimes have a hard time breathing.\nA. by including more details to support the main idea\nB. by clearly stating the main idea\nC. by removing information unrelated to the main idea\nAnswer is:",
