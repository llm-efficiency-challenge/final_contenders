# neurips-submission


**Update 2023/11/18:** For model reproducibility, we have updated model path in submission_2 directory. Here is the [commit](https://github.com/akjindal53244/neurips-submission/commit/e29e562040445d820e429428f2269216dbe6eed7). Kindly pull the latest changes.

- **Note:** We haven't been able to test the docker file as we do not have access to the required resources for testing inference code. We hope that inference should work just like before since we have only updated model path.
